                <i>Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level
                        virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers
                        are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and
                        configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined
                        channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating
                        system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines."</i>
